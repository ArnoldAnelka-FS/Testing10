In this assignment:

I am going to write unit test using TDD.

I will be writing unit tests for an application that will obscure a credit card number.

I will write a single function to obscure a credit card number.
The function argument should be a string and return a string.
The credit cards are 12 numbers in size.
Any other size should return "Invalid Credit Card"
I didn't validate if the characters are numbers.
I have positive and negative unit tests for my function.
